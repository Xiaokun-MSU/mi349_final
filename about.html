        <p class="imporInfor" >Hi, again. My name is Xiaokun Chen. I am a senior student from Michigan State University and I am majoring in Information Science. </p>
        <p>I like to play video games, like <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legend</a>, 
            and <a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/">brawl Stars</a>. I also like to listen to music, 
            and play guitar sometimes. My favorite singer is Jay Chou from China. 
            I used to learn Python and C Plus Plus. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            I am currently learning React and Vue. I have already used React to design a website called 'Anime Search Engine.'  Additionally, I had the opportunity to work at Fuyao Automotive North America, a company that produces car glass. I am very happy to enter the IT department, although only two short months, I and another intern contributed a single page to this company, and independently designed and modified the electronic board in the factory. I also participated in some changes of the employee card system. If you have the same experience as me or want to make friends with me, 
            please click on "Contact Me" on the navigation page. If you do not find it, you also can click on my picture on the left. 
            Oops, there is one more thing I want to tell you, I do not speak English very well. So the best way is to 
            use Email or Message to contact me. </p>
