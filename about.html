        <p class="imporInfor">Hi, again. My name is Xiaokun Chen. I comes from China. I am a junior from Michigan State University and 
            I am majoring in Information Science. </p>
        <p>I like to play video games, like <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legend</a>, 
            and <a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/">brawl Stars</a>. I also like to listen to music, 
            and play guitar sometimes. My favorite singer is Jay Chou from China. 
            I used to learn Python and C Plus Plus. If you ask me which programming language I frefer. 
            I will say Python! I think Python is both simple to learn and use. I am learning HTML, CSS, and
            I am trying to learn JavaScript. If you have the same experience as me or want to make friends with me, 
            please click on "Contact Me" on the navigation page. If you do not find it, you also can click on my picture on the left. 
            Oops, there is one more thing I want to tell you, I do not speak English very well. So the best way is to 
            use Email or Message to contact me. </p>
